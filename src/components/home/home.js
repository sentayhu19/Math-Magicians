<p>As time passed, many mathematicians gravitated towards universities. An emphasis on free thinking and experimentation had begun in Britain's oldest
     universities beginning in the seventeenth century at Oxford with the scientists Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle, and at Cambridge where Isaac
      Newton was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and
     Physics. Moving into the 19th century, the objective of universities all across Europe evolved from teaching the "regurgitation of knowledge" to 
    "encourag[ing] productive thinking."[5] In 1810, Humboldt convinced the King of Prussia to build a university in Berlin based on Friedrich Schleiermacher's
     liberal ideas; the goal was to demonstrate the process of the discovery of knowledge and to teach students to "take account of 
     fundamental laws of science in all their thinking."</p>
     
<p>British universities of this period adopted some approaches familiar to the Italian and German universities, but as they already enjoyed
     substantial freedoms and autonomy the changes there had begun with the Age of Enlightenment, the same influences that inspired Humboldt.
      The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge emphasized the importance of research, arguably more authentically implementing Humboldt's idea 
      of a university than even German universities, which were subject to state authority.[7] Overall, science (including mathematics) became 
      the focus of universities in the 19th and 20th centuries. </p>
